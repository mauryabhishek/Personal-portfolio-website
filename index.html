                <p>In this project, the user can input a location in the input field and click the "Get Weather" button. The JavaScript code uses the fetch API to request weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's input. The received data is then displayed on the web page.

                    Please note that you need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key obtained from a weather API provider like OpenWeatherMap. Also, be aware of the usage limits and terms of service of the API provider you choose.</p>
